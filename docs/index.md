# SnipKit

![Demo](./images/demo.gif){ align=left }

## Execute the scripts saved in your favorite snippet manager without even leaving the terminal.

Retrieve snippets from a list of external snippet managers, so you can keep your scripts all at one place and manage 
them more easily:

* Search for snippets by typing.

* Execute them with parameters. Define default values or a list of pre-defined values to pick from.

* Customize SnipKit with a theme to match the look of your terminal.
