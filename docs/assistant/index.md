# SnipKit Assistant

The assistant helps you to write SnipKit snippets with the help auf AI.

![Assistant Demo](../images/assistant.gif)

## Supported AI providers

- OpenAI 
- Gemimi 

## Configuration

This command lets you enable the assistant by editing your SnipKit configuration file:

```sh title="Enable or switch to a different AI provider"
snipkit assistant choose
```

You will need to provide an API key for the corresponding AI provider via an environment variable.

[configuration]: ../configuration/overview.md

```yaml title="config.yaml"
version: 1.2.0
config:
  assistant:
    # Defines if you want to save the snippets created by the assistant. Possible values: NEVER | FS_LIBRARY
    saveMode: NEVER
    openai:
      enabled: false
      # ....
    gemini:
      enabled: false
      # ....
```

!!! note
    Maximal one AI provider can be set to `enabled: true`. If all providers are set to `enabled: false` the assistant won't work.

## Save generate snippets

SnipKit supports saving any generated snippets to your [File System Library][fslibrary].

If you set `saveMode: FS_LIBRARY` SnipKit asks you for snippets generated by the assistant if you want to save them. If set to `NEVER` you won't be asked and the script is dismissed after execution.

```yaml title="config.yaml"
version: 1.2.0
config:
  assistant:
    saveMode: FS_LIBRARY
    
```
!!! note
    The [File System Library manager][fslibrary] must be enabled.

[fslibrary]: ../managers/fslibrary.md
