## Local development

### Setting up a dev environment

Setting up a test environment involves the following steps:

* Install [go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
* Run `pre-commit install`
* For working on the documentation:
    * Install [mkdcos](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
    * Install [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)

After this, you'll be able to test any change. Alternativley, you can open the project in Gitpod:

### Commands

Check if everything works as expected:

```bash
make ci 
```

This command will run all tests as well as the linter to check if there are any issues.

During development, the following commands may also be beneficial to you:

```bash
make build # Build the binary files
make test # Run all tests
make lint # Run the linter to detect any issues
make mocks # (Re-)generate the mock files
pre-commit run --all-files # Run all pre-commit hooks manually
```
